## Basics of C++/Python&#x20;

### 1. C++ Programming

Don't worry if you do not know about C++, as long as you have some experience with C programming. We will learn the basics of C++ programming in class through several tutorials.

It would be helpful if you could study the basics of C++ beforehand.

Recommended sites for C++ tutorials

### 2. Python Programming

Also, don't worry if you do not know about Python programming.

We will learn the necessary Python programming techniques in class.

But, you are encouraged to study Python programming by yourself before the midterm.

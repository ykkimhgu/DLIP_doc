# Prerequisite


You are required to follow the software installation instructions before class. Also, you are strongly recommended to review or study the selected topics before class.

# 1. Installation for Image Processing with OpenCV C++

You must install the followings before the 1st week lecture.


## (1) Visual Studio

### Installation for Win OS

* Visual Studio Community 20xx: [instruction](https://ykkim.gitbook.io/dlip/dlip-installation-guide/ide/visual-studio-community)

> It is V.S. Community, NOT V.S. Code.   Visual Studio Code is not recommended for C++, for you need to compile and run separately.&#x20;


## (2) OpenCV C++

* OpenCV 4.x: [instruction](https://ykkim.gitbook.io/dlip/dlip-installation-guide/opencv/opencv-install)
> OpenCV 3.x is also acceptable


## For Mac OS user 
* Xcode and OpenCV C++ : [instruction](installation-guide/opencv/opencv-install/macos-opencv-c++-in-xcode.md)

> Visual Studio Code (MacOS) is not recommended for C++, for you need to compile and run separately.&#x20;



# 2. Studying C++ / Python Programming

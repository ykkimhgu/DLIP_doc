## I. Introduction

This lab is about \~

Write a short abstract of the project with necessary diagram.





## II. Problem Statement

### Project objectives

Explain the objectives of the project



This project aims to develop an AI-powered vision system for a waste recycling system that sort the waste type with a robot arm. Specifically, this project needs to 

* Develop a model that can detect and classify a recyclable waste product
  *  4 classes of PET, PVC, Metal, Glass
* Locate and display the waste with a boundary box
* Sort the waste product with a robot arm
* Display the statistics of each waste product



### Expected Outcomes  

Explain what outcome and evaluation index you are going to achieve.

* A classification deep learning model that can recognize waste type
* A robot arm and conveyor belt system that can sort the waste automatically 
* GUI that display the statistics of the fault rate 



### Evaluation Index

| Evaluation Index                            | Goal    | Comments                 |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------ |
| 1. Accuracy of object detection             | >90%    | Test image of 500 frames |
| 2. F1-score of Anomaly Classification       | >00     |                          |
| 3. Estimate accuracy of the detection model | >00     |                          |
| 4. Inference Time (FPS)                     | >10 fps | GTX1080 TI               |

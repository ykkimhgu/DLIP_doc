# LAB: Facial Temperature Measurement with IR images

## I. Introduction

In this lab, you are required to create a simple program that detects the temperature of a person wearing a mask. You will be given a video of IR images of several people measuring their face temperature. Measure the maximum and average temperature of the face (excluding the mask) and show a warning sign if the average temperature is above 38.0 C.

We will not use any deep learning or any other complex algorithms. Just use simple image processing methods such as :

 InRange, Morphology, Filtering, findContour

 Refer to \[Tutorial: Color Image Segmentation] for programming tips

## II. Procedure

### Part 1. Face Segmentation excluding mask

#### Segmentation using InRange()

Recommendation: use the program code given in \[Tutorial:color segemtation]

* Analyze the color space of the raw image. You can use either RGB or HSV space
* Apply necessary pre-processing, such as filtering.
* By using InRange(), segment the area of ROI: exposed skin (face and neck) that are not covered by cloth and mask. You must use inRange of all 3-channels of the color image.
* Apply post-processing such as morphology to enhance the object segmentation.
* Use findContours() to detect all the connected objects
* Select only the proper contour around the face. (Hint: can use the contour area)
* Then, draw the final contour and a box using drawContours( ), boundingRect(), rectangle( )
* Need to show example results of each process.

### Part 2. Temperature Measurement

#### Temperature from Intensity data

The intensity value of the image is the temperature data scaled within the pre-defined temperature range. Use the intensity value to estimate the temperature.

* Analyze the intensity values(grayscale, 0-255) of the given image.
* The actual temperature for this lab is ranged from 25(I=0) to 40 C (I=255).
* Estimate the (1) maximum temperature and (2) average tempearture within ONLY the segmented area (Contour Area)
* For average tempeature, use the data within the Top 5% of the tempeature in Descending order.
  * Hint: cv∷sort( ) in SORT\_DESCENDING
* Show the result as TEXT on the final output image.
  * Hint: cv∷putText( )
* Your final output should be similar to result of the the Demo\_Video.

## III. Report and Demo Video

You are required to write a consice lab report and submit the program files and the demo video.

Lab Report:

* Show what you have done with concise explanations and example results of each necessary process
* In the appendix, show your source code.
* Submit in both PDF and original file (\*.docx etc)
* No need to print out. Only the On-Line submission.

Demo Video:

* Create a demo video with a title page showing the course name, data and your names
* Submit in Hisnet

Source Code:

* Zip all the necessary source files.
* Only the source code files. Do not submit image files, project files etc.
